## 4_Machine_Learning_Algorithms.ipynb
This is a python notebook containing 4 different machine learning models that we used to predict whether or not a crime was violent, It also contains a list of the feature importances that we got from the Random Forest

## \`Case Study Presentation.pdf\`
This file contains the presentation slides that we used when presenting our results

## Time_Series_Model.R
This file contains all of the code that we used to fit the time series models as well as validate our assumptions. It also contains code for generating many of the exploratory plots that we used.

## nn_shap.ipynb
This file contains the code used to fit and train our neural network as well as generate shap values for a random forest model. Both were used to predict number of daily crimes
